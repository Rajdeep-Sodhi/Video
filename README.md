This is a webpage that runs a 13-second video repeatedly. 
First a preloader gif appears until the webpage is ready to connect, then the video plays on its own with a pause/play button at the bottom left. 
If the video is being played, only the pause button is shown, but once the pause button is pressed, a blue slider slides to the right, covering the pause button and showing the play button while the video is paused.
As for when the play button is pressed vis visa. 
That's all, thanks for taking an interest!
